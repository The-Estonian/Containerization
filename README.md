## How to run

Have Vagrant, Postman and VirtualBox installed

Git clone the project, cd inside it and run

```python
vagrant up
```

Wait 5-10m until Vagrant loads all 3 VMs, runs all the scrips to install all the dependencies, generates the databases etc.

Open Postman and query the Gateway database with beforementioned APIs as seen in the video.
